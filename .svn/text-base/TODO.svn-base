* Synchronous versions of operations.

 This may make more sense for some (publishing) than for others
(browsing).  E.g, PUBLISH-SYNC could signal errors directly.
BROWSE-SYNC could take a timeout argument.  The advantage here would
be that it would make these operations slightly easier to use.

* Windows support.

* Examples.

I really want to include some neat examples.  Crazy CLiki integration
(for use at ILCs?), distcc for Lisp, etc.

* Threading.

It might be nice to at least describe how to use
PROCESS-DNS-SD-EVENTS, but better might be to actually set up an event
handling thread.  Or at least offer the option.
