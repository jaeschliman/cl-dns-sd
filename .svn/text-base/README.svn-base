DNS-SD
======

A Common Lisp interface to Apple's open source implementation of the
DNS Service Discovery protocol [http://www.dns-sd.org].

This library is basically a clone of John Wiseman's CL-ZEROCONF using
CFFI instead of UFFI, and with the smaller scope of handling the
DNS-SD protocol exclusively (which is the only protocol CL-ZEROCONF
handles for the moment anyway).
